			<p class="c221">As far as I know, neural networks are becoming pretty good at a lot of things these days. What are they? In essence, we may think
of a neural network as a function $f$ controlled by the set of parameters $\theta$ between hyperspaces $\Re^p$ and $\Re^q$, ie. $f_\theta : \Re^p \to \Re^q$.
But first, let us describe a single neuron, intuitively, following its most common mathematical formulation.</p>
			<p class="c221">Biologically, a neuron receives impulses from other neurons, is excited by them to an extent, and subsequently generates a response.
If a neuron receives impulses from $p$ other neurons, its impulse $x$ to response $z$ characteristics may be mathematically modeled as a map $n_w: \Re^p \to
\Re$. Some neurons excite it more, some less: hence its excitement may be approximated as a weighted mean, ie. $a = \Sigma^{p}_{i = 1} w_i \cdot x_i$. The
neuron is usually sensitive to a particular range of excitements and its response generally trails off with 'distance' from this range. The response may then
be considered a nonlinear function of the excitement, ie. $z = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}$. This function $z(a)$ is called the sigmoid.</p>
			<p class="c221">Now if we stack $q$ of these neurons into a layer, each with their separate set of weights $w \in W$, we obtain a neural layer $l_W:
\Re^p \to \Re^q$. And if we connect layers by feeding the outputs of one layer to the inputs of the next, we obtain a neural network. It really is that simple.
But is this artificial construction enough for them to do all the neat things we have heard of? Not nearly. Then, how do they do it? They aren't 'special':
they too must be trained. There are basically $2$ types of training: supervised and unsupervised. By extension there are $2$ classes of networks, depending on
how they have been trained. Supervised training is generally used to make function approximators, while unsupervised training is used to make feature
extractors.</p>
			<p class="c221">A supervised training set consists of training samples of inputs and expected outputs, and looks like $\{(x_i, y_i) | x_i \in
\Re^p, y_i \in \Re^q\}_{i = 1}^{n}$. The goal is to have the neural network learn a generalized mapping such that $f_\theta (x_i) \approx y_i \forall i$.
We choose a set of parameters $\theta^\star$ which minimizes a cost function $|\cdot|$ as $\theta^\star = \underset{\theta}{\text{argmin}}
\Sigma^{n}_{i = 1}|f_\theta(x_i) - y_i|$. That does not seem too difficult. But the beauty of neural networks is that they can even generate 'sensible' outputs
even for inputs which were not in the training set: they can generalize, they can 'learn'.</p>
			<p class="c221">An unsupervised training set, on the other hand, consists only of inputs, and looks like $\{x_i | x_i \in \Re^p\}_{i = 1}^{n}$. The
goal is far more involved, and the outcome far more intriguing. The network learns a q dimensional representation of the p dimensional data, which can be used
in place of the original vector, and thought of as a tuple of extracted features. Why is this so brilliant? Because it allows us to construct hierarchical
abstractions for different forms of data representation, giving rise to some very exciting properties. How is this done? A common method is to define a $2^{nd}$
reconstruction function $g_\phi : \Re^q \to \Re^p$ to apporximate $g_\phi(f_\theta(x_i)) \approx x_i \forall i$.</p>
