As far as I know, simply being able to generate legal moves does not allow us to win a game of chess - unless it is played against a random-move-generator-like
monkey. The trick is to find the best move. But in this case the definition of best, if there is one, is highly ambiguous, especially given that a move that
looks good in a position may turn out to be somewhat less than impressive in the future. For $2$-player, deterministic games, ie. for games in which nothing is
left to chance, our best move is only as good as our opponent's best response will allow it to be. This philosophy is at the heart of the Minimax algorithm.

<pre><code>function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer)
	if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node
		return the heuristic value of node
	if maximizingPlayer
		best ← -∞
		for each child of node
			value ← minimax(child, depth - 1, FALSE)
			best ← max(best, value)
		return best
	else
		best ← ∞
		for each child of node
			value ← minimax(child, depth - 1, TRUE)
			best ← min(best, value)
		return best</code></pre>

The two players are modeled as having two antagonistic objectives. One attempts to generate moves to maximize the utility score of the game state, while the
other attempts to generate moves to minimize the same. When it is not possible to come up with a perfectly rational untility function, a suitable heuristic is
used. In chess, the simplest such is to use a weighted sum of the number of pieces of one side, and subtract from it the same for the pieces of the other side.
This works quite well in practice. Classically, knights, bishops, rooks, and queens are worth $3^-$, $3^+$, $5$ and $9$ pawns, respectively. The king is, quite
obviously, invaluable.

Other factors such as piece mobility, piece connectivity, board control, piece formations (batteries, doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed
pawns), trapped pieces, king safety (pawn shield, king tropism), tempo, etc. tempered by the phase of the game - opening, middlegame, endgame - are used to
augment this value. All these factors put together account only for a few pawns worth, but may prove to be decisive in close calls. However, we must remember
that the more complicated our evaluation function is, the more time we need to spend processing it. A cheap function which works well in practice when used to
search to a greater depth may yield better results than an expensive function prohibiting the depth to which we can search.

For sum-$0$ games, ie. for games where it is crystal clear that our gain corresponds exactly to our opponent's loss, an elegant version of Minimax called
Negated MiniMax or NegaMax may be used. It uses the fact that the score of one player is the additive inverse of the score of the other.
</p>

<pre><code>function negamax(node, depth, color)
	if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node
		return color × the heuristic value of node
	best ← -∞
	for each child of node
		value ← -negamax(child, depth - 1, -color)
		best ← max(best, value)
	return best</code></pre>

An interesting phenomenon is observed on the horizon, called the Horizon Effect. The heuristic score is generally calculated at a static board position, at
some depth. Consider a situation where a pawn, defended by another, is captured by the queen. The static score would show the advantage of a pawn, rather than
reflect the blunder that we just entered into the exchange of a queen for a pawn. To counter situations like these, it is prudent to play out the sequence of
captures that the last move might have initiated. Since either player may choose to discontinue the sequence of exchanges at any point, we must consider
captures with only the least valuable piece at every point.

<pre><code>function staticexchangeevaluation(square, color)
	if square is not attacked by side
		return 0
	piece, piecevalue ← getsmallestattacker(square, side)
	capture(piece, square)
	value ← max(0, piecevalue - staticexchangeevaluation(square, -color))
	undocapture(piece, square)
	return value</code></pre>
